## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

### "Invalid strength"
**Problem:** The strength value doesn't match expected format

**Solution:** Make sure you use exactly these values:
- Batsman
- Batting All rounder
- Bowling All rounder
- All rounder
- Bowling

### "Invalid house"
**Problem:** House name is misspelled or has extra spaces

**Solution:** Use exactly: Aravali, Shivalik, Udaigiri, or Nilgiri

### "Invalid batch"
**Problem:** Batch is not a number or is outside 1-30 range

**Solution:** Batch must be a whole number between 1 and 30

### "Missing name"
**Problem:** Name column is empty

**Solution:** Every player must have a name

## üí° Tips

1. **Phone numbers are optional** - If a player doesn't have a phone number, leave the cell empty
2. **Test first** - Always run with `--dry-run` first to catch errors
3. **Check spelling** - House and strength values must match exactly
4. **No extra columns needed** - The script will ignore any extra columns in your Excel
5. **Duplicates are skipped** - Players with the same name and batch won't be imported twice

## üìä What Gets Imported

From your Excel, the script will import:
- ‚úÖ Player name
